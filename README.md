# DAO Using Plutocracy Token Model

## Introduction

The **DAO Using Plutocracy Token Model** is a smart contract system designed to implement a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) using the concept of a plutocracy-based voting mechanism. This README provides an overview of the project's objectives, functionalities, and usage instructions.

## Features

1. **DAO Governance:** The core feature of this project is the implementation of a DAO that enables members to collectively make decisions.

2. **Voting Mechanism:** Every proposed transaction that the DAO intends to send requires a voting process. Each member's voting power is determined by the number of ERC20 tokens they hold.

3. **ERC20 Tokens:** The project utilizes the ERC20 token standard for voting. These tokens represent ownership and voting power within the DAO.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- A compatible Ethereum development environment (e.g., [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle) and [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache), preferred[Foundry]).
- Basic understanding of smart contracts, Ethereum, and the ERC20 token standard.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local development environment.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/itsPriyanshuhere/DAO_using_Plutocracy_Token_Model.git
   cd DAO_using_Plutocracy_Token_Model
